# Green Emoji

## Meeting the Turtles
There are 4 turtles, boo, oogway, maturin, and eros. They love eating spinach and pass the time by dancing. oogway,
the oldest turtle, writes poetry and plays the piano. None of the turtles' names are capitalized because they are not
important.

## The Design
Though simple, the emoji chosen demonstrates a person about to puke from awful food, but trying to be polite and eat it.
The four turtles worked very hard for their creation, and wish that you enjoy it.
